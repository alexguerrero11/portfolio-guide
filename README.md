## [Workout Dashboard](https://github.com/alexguerrero11/workout-dash)
My goal last year was to start going to the gym more frequently. I began to record my workout data in Google Sheets over the years. Using the Streamlit app to generate a dashboard to track and visualize my exercises over time. The dashboard displays some KPIs listed below. In addition, it allows you to select a muscle group, view an overview of workout data, and highlight weight progression for each exercise in the chosen muscle group.
- Count the days out of the current week.
- Count the days out of the current month.
- Total Count of Records in the dataset.
